console.log(fruits[1]);
by this we can access the elements of the array one by one but to print out all
of them at once we have to use the concept of looping

For loop------->
for(let i=0;i<fruits.length;i++){
	console.log(fruits[i])
}//it will print all the elements present in the fruits array
fruits.length -------->determines the array length 
......advanced syntax of a for loop
for(const fruit of fruits)
{
 console.log(fruit)
}//here we don't have to worry about indices inside the for loop
